### Introduction
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that
we can customize to solve a particular design problem in the code.

In this repository I have been collected the best 
examples of classic design patterns from below page

#### Behavioral patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and
the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- **Chain of Responsibility**

    Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that
    lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving
    a request, each handler decides either to process the request or
    to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

 - **Visitor**
 
    Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate
    algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
